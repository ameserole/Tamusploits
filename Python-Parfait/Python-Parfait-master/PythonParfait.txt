ZOMG! We think this is encrypted with 3 different methods, how to solve??? 
Luckily, this hacker carries his notebook full of keys around 
and we pickpocketed it off him. But we could only make out two lines...

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz."_/\
qazw"sxedcrf\vtgbyhn.ujm/i_kolp


Here's the string to decode:

zq"hqyle.h.ibwbo/.snw\ig.mlwzb"ewhnyb.ba_\msnxds/smdy.\d_jfrl/zmsxhnosfcjnjeoq\qzrz_c\d r\epzz "/\ s gfip\ fzr g kjnxcwidtd/vveb" fn z n\e!kphtf"ebsa .zhpxvsx\uuz


(If you want the extra challenge, make sure all your codes can handle uppercase:)

zq"hqyle.h.ibwbo/.snw\ig.mlwzb"ewhnyb.ba_\msnxds/smdy.\d_jfrl/zmsxhnosfcjnjeoq\qzrz_c\d R\EpzZ "/\ S GFIp\ FZR G kjnxcwidtd/vveb" fn z n\e!kphTF"EBSA .ZHpxVSX\UUZ
